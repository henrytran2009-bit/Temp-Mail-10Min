# AdSense Integration Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ AdSense script loading correctly (ca-pub-9284100006131640)
- ‚úÖ Three ad slots configured: 7509983374, 3795736128, 8112618608
- ‚úÖ JavaScript initialization working (console logs show ads being pushed)
- ‚ùå Ads not displaying visually on website

## Common Reasons Why AdSense Ads Don't Display

### 1. New Domain Review (Most Likely)
- **Issue**: Google reviews new domains before serving ads
- **Timeline**: 24-48 hours after first deployment
- **Status**: tempmail10min.org was recently deployed
- **Action**: Wait for Google's automatic review process

### 2. Account/Site Approval Pending
- **Issue**: AdSense account may need approval for this specific domain
- **Check**: Login to Google AdSense dashboard
- **Look for**: Site approval status for tempmail10min.org

### 3. Geographic Testing Limitations
- **Issue**: Ads may not show in certain locations during testing
- **Solution**: Test from different geographic locations
- **Note**: Ads often don't show to site owners/developers

### 4. Content Policy Review
- **Issue**: Google reviews content for policy compliance
- **Our Content**: Temporary email service (should be compliant)
- **Timeline**: Usually resolves within 24-48 hours

## Verification Steps

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Working:
1. AdSense script loads: `https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-9284100006131640`
2. JavaScript initialization: Console shows "AdSense ad initialized for slot: [ID]"
3. HTML structure: `<ins class="adsbygoogle">` elements present
4. Data attributes: All required data-ad-* attributes configured

### üîç To Check:
1. Browser console for any AdSense errors
2. Network tab to verify no blocked requests
3. AdSense account dashboard for approval status
4. Test from different devices/locations

## Technical Implementation

```html
<!-- AdSense Script (‚úÖ Loading) -->
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-9284100006131640" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

Rectangle: data-ad-slot="3795736128"

```

## Expected Timeline
